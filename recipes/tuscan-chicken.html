    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>In the image above is a Creamy Tuscan Chicken I made based off a TikTok I saw. This was a hit with my family and all who tried it.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>4 boneless skinless chicken breasts</li>
            <li>Pink himalayan salt to taste</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons of butter</li>
            <li>3 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups of cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
            <li>3 cups of baby spinach</li>
            <li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>1/4 cup freshly grated parmesan</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps for cooking</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a pan over medium heat, heat your oil. Add chicken and season with salt, pepper and oregano. Cook until golden and no longer pink, about 8 minutes per side. Remove from pan and set aside to rest.</li>
            <li>In the same pan over medium heat, melt butter. Stir in garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add cherry tomatoes and season with salt and pepper. Cook until tomatoes are beginning to burst then add spinach and cook until spinach is beginning to wilt.</li>
            <li>Stir in heavy cream and parmesan and bring mixture to a simmer. Reduce heat to low and simmer until sauce is slightly reduced, about 3 minutes. Return chicken to skillet and cook until heated through, about 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
            <li>Serve with bread or as is. Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
